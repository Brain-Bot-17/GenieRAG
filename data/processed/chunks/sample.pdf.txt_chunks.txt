Abstract. Stress is a critical health issue with significant implications for both physical and
---
mental well-being. Early detection and accurate classification of stress levels are crucial for
timely intervention and effective management. This study proposes a deep-learning framework
for early stress detection using physiological data from wrist-worn devices. The framework uti-
lizes Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals, which are processed with advanced preprocessing
techniques. It uses both extracted features and the complete feature set of the EDA signal in
---
a custom deep-learning model to effectively distinguish between stress and non-stress states.
The study also explores multimodal signal fusion by combining EDA with electrocardiogram
(ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals to evaluate its effectiveness in early stress
detection. However, the results show that EDA signals alone outperform the combined signals
for early stress detection. The methodology was trained and tested on six publicly avail-
---
able EDA-based stress datasets: VerBIO, UTD, WESAD, SWELL-KW, MSD Nurses, and
DriveDB. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework achieves 95% accuracy and a
90% F1-score in early stress detection. These findings highlight the potential of the proposed
framework for real-world applications in stress management, providing a reliable, continuous,
and non-invasive tool for early stress monitoring through wearable technology.

Introduction
Early stress detection is gaining prominence due to its potential for fast diagnosis of stress severity
levels and its application in analyzing stress associated with critical health conditions using artificial
intelligence (AI) [1]. Stress, a complex psycho-physiological state, manifests as a response to various
---
challenging situations or specific events encountered in daily life [2]. According to existing literature,
stress can be categorized into several types: (1) acute stress, (2) chronic stress, (3) episodic acute
stress, (4) eustress, and (5) distress. Acute stress is typically short-term and arises from immediate
pressures, while chronic stress persists over time and often results from ongoing challenges. Episodic
---
acute stress is observed in individuals with chaotic lifestyles, involving recurrent episodes of acute
stress [3]. Eustress, a positive form of stress, occurs in situations perceived as beneficial, whereas
distress is a harmful form of stress with negative impacts on physical and mental health [4]. Chronic
or extreme stress can lead to serious health issues, including depression, cardiovascular problems,
immune system dysfunction, digestive disorders, and other related concerns [5].
---
Stress can be measured through psychological or physiological data. Traditional methods primar-
ily rely on psychological data for early stress detection, often involving interactive questionnaires;
however, these methods frequently lack accuracy [6]. While statistical machine learning techniques
are commonly employed for stress detection, they often fall short in providing comprehensive anal-
ysis when dealing with multimodal data. To overcome these limitations, AI has emerged as a piv-
---
otal tool for early stress classification. Researchers are increasingly leveraging AI-driven models

A. Singh et al.
to predict stress severity with greater accuracy, using data from smartphones, smartwatches, and
human-computer interfaces (HCI) [7].
Various machine learning and deep learning approaches have been proposed for early stress di-
agnosis. Psychological data is typically collected through self-report devices and health monitoring
tools, enabling stress analysis via verbal questionnaires or interviews [8]. Interactions between in-
---
dividuals and professionals allow for the expression and assessment of stress related experiences in
diverse environments. Observations of behavioral changes, physiological alterations, psychological
fluctuations, mood swings, sleep disturbances, and shifts in interpersonal relationships are crucial
for interpreting psychological responses to stress [9]. For physiological data-based stress detection,
wearable devices play a key role in monitoring indicators such as heart rate (HR), heart rate vari-
---
ability (HRV), blood pressure (BP), skin temperature, EDA, ECG, and PPG [10]. Smart devices
equipped with these sensors can facilitate early stress detection.
This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing EDA signals for early stress detection using
wrist-worn devices. EDA signals, which reflect skin conductance changes, can be tracked using smart-
watches like Fitbit Sense and Empatica E4, which employ EDA sensors for stress and mood analysis.
---
The study evaluates the effectiveness of three deep learning models, the Feedforward Neural Network
(FNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Wide and Deep Learning models, in classifying
stress and non-stress states. Training and testing were performed using raw and extracted features
of EDA to identify the most effective method for predicting stress severity. The results demonstrate
that extracted features are more effective. Additionally, this work examines the potential of cus-
---
tomized multimodal approaches for wrist-mounted wearables, identifying the modalities that offer
the highest accuracy in stress classification.
The major contributions of this work are as follows:
1. Development of a deep learning framework for early stress detection using EDA signals from
wrist-worn devices.
2. Implementation and comparison of multiple deep learning models, FNN, CNN, and Wide and
Deep, for early stress classification.

their combinations, showing that EDA-based classification achieves the highest performance in
stress assessment.

Related Work
This section reviews the literature on early stress detection, with a particular focus on the role of
AI in analyzing physiological signals. Initial studies primarily utilized traditional machine learning
techniques. For example, Moghimi et al. [11] employed Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify
stress based on signals such as Skin Conductance Response (SCR), Electroencephalogram (EEG),
---
and Heart Rate (HR). Similarly, Maaoui et al. [12] used ensemble learning methods to classify stress
based on multiple signals, including Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) and Electromyography (EMG).
However, these approaches often faced challenges due to the complexity of multimodal data.
Recent advancements have seen a shift towards deep learning, which has demonstrated improved
accuracy in stress detection. Movahedi et al. [13] proposed a deep learning framework to extract fea-
---
tures from EEG signals using wearable devices, though it faced challenges with overfitting. To address
this, Yang et al. [14] developed a hierarchical neural network combined with ensemble learning to
improve the robustness of stress classification. Electrodermal Activity (EDA) has proven particularly
effective for stress detection. Studies by Choi et al. [15] and Anusha et al. [16] successfully used EDA
signals to assess stress and anxiety. Additionally, Zontone et al. [17] combined EDA with ECG data

to measure driver anxiety, while Liu et al. [18] employed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) on
EDA signals to classify stress during driving, achieving an 81.82% recognition rate.
The potential of deep learning combined with multimodal physiological data for stress detection is
also becoming increasingly evident. Rim et al. [19] reviewed the application of deep learning to various
---
physiological signals, including EMG, ECG, and EEG, for medical tasks. Similarly, Santamaria et
al. [20] used a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with ECG and EDA data for emotion
recognition. Thiam et al. [21] employed a CNN architecture with EDA, ECG, and EMG signals,
achieving 84.57% accuracy in distinguishing between painful and non-painful states. These studies
illustrate the growing use of deep learning and multimodal data fusion for early stress detection,
---
with EDA emerging as a key physiological marker. A summary of recent work and a comparison
with the proposed EDA method for stress detection are provided in Table-1.

Reason for Using EDA in Early Stress Detection
EDA measures variations in the skin electrical properties, which are closely related to sweat gland
activity. EDA signals are characterized by two primary components: the tonic and phasic levels. The
tonic level, indicated by the Skin Conductance Level (SCL), serves as a stable, slow-changing baseline
that reflects skin moisture and autonomic function. On the other hand, the phasic level, measured by
---
the Skin Conductance Response (SCR), exhibits more dynamic fluctuations, especially in reaction
to stimuli. SCRs can appear as sharp peaks following specific events (event-related SCRs) or can
occur spontaneously (non-specific SCRs). Essential features of event-related SCRs include latency
(time from stimulus to response onset), peak amplitude (difference between onset and peak), rise
time (duration from onset to peak), and recovery time (time from peak to full recovery) as shown
---
in the Figure-2. These features provide valuable insights into emotional responses and engagement
with stimuli, making EDA a powerful tool for real-time monitoring.

including latency, peak amplitude, rise time, and recovery time.

This study leverages six publicly available datasets, each containing EDA signals, along with ad-
---
ditional physiological signals ECG, PPG, and other signals. These datasets were selected for their
diversity in signal types, coverage across different skin areas, and variation in activities and age
groups of participants. The data was collected using various devices, each tailored to the specific
objectives of the respective studies. Figure-3 illustrates the different devices used for data collec-
tion. The datasets utilized in this study are VerBIO[26], SWELL-KW[27], WESAD[28], UTD[29],
---
MSD Nurse[30], and DriveDB[31]. Table-2 provides a comprehensive overview of these datasets,
with further details discussed below. The primary reason for selecting these datasets is the avail-
ability of EDA signals recorded using different devices during various activities, which enhances the
effectiveness of stress severity prediction models.

sessions, with data from 18 individuals captured using Empatica E4 devices. A total of 344 speeches
were delivered to either real or virtual audiences. The EDA data was recorded at 4 Hz and labeled

data from 15 female nurses during their regular hospital shifts, totaling 1,250 hours. Physiological
signals, including EDA, heart rate, skin temperature, and accelerometer data, were recorded using

to ensure the integrity of the data.

Methodology
The method for predicting stress severity involves mapping input physiological signals to an output
indicating stress levels. Our approach focuses on early diagnosis and accurate prediction of stress
severity through a binary classification task, distinguishing between stress with severity measures
and non-stress states. Let E = [e1, e2, et, · · · , en] represent a sample of physiological signal input,
---
the EDA data sample. Here, et signifies the EDA measurement obtained using Siemens at discrete
time t. The stress detection problem is formulated as follows:
[s, ϵ] = C(Ew, θ)
(1)
Where s = {0, 1} represents the severity stress state, with s = 1 indicating the stress state (Un-
healthy) and s = 0 indicating the non-stress state (Healthy). Ew ∈E represents a discriminatory
subset of EDA physiological signal features based on the segmentation method, where w < n. C
---
denotes the classifier, and θ represents the corresponding coefficients. A deep learning algorithm
learns the classifier based on physiological signals and associated discriminatory feature coefficients.
4.1
Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a critical step in this study, as it ensures the quality and consistency of the EDA
signals and other signals before they are used for stress severity prediction. This process involves
four main steps, as illustrated in Figure-4.
---
four main steps, as illustrated in Figure-4.
Data Segmentation The collected EDA data represents various everyday activities of subjects,
with acquisition times ranging from five minutes to more than two hours, and sometimes even a week.
However, handling extensive amounts of EDA data poses challenges regarding computational cost
and data consistency. To address these challenges, we segmented the collected EDA data into distinct
---
lengths, aiming to create manageable data chunks that still capture essential features [32]. This
segmentation reduces processing time and computational costs. Second-order statistical measures
were employed for clustering the segmented data, and labels were annotated by minute using a non-
overlapping sliding window approach (Hamming Window Method) for further processing [33]. The
datasets used include Verbio, WESAD, UDT, MSD-Nurse, and DriveDB, encompassing activities
---
across multiple domains. To ensure a fair comparison and enhance dataset consistency, data related
to physical activity from UTD were excluded. Specifically, data labeled as "PhysicalStress," obtained
when participants were standing or walking, was removed. The Hamming window-based approach
is used to taper the physiological signal windows to zero at the start and end of each cluster of the
discriminatory set of features for accurate stress prediction. The window function w(n) is defined as
follows:

Normalization Normalization is crucial for mitigating data redundancy in raw EDA signals, laying
the groundwork for effective feature extraction and classification. Initially, the data is scaled into
the [0,1] range, followed by the application of the moving average filtering method to minimize the
---
effects of noise and other specific artifacts in the normalized data [34]. The z-score method is then
employed to ensure standardized data for robust analysis, defined as follows:
z = x −µ
σ
(4)
where µ is the mean of a sample, σ is the standard deviation of the sample, z is the standard score,
and x is the observed value.
Filtering To mitigate noise and unwanted frequency components in raw EDA data, a Moving
Average (MA) based filtering method is employed. This, combined with a low-pass filter, smooths

signals while preserving meaningful peaks [35]. The evaluation of x[N] using M prior values ensures
effective noise suppression. Smoothing signals (X[N]) while preserving peaks is essential for the
accurate representation of physiological responses. A low-pass filter of order 5, combined with MA,
enhances signal clarity, which is crucial for deeper insights into emotional arousal and stress severity
prediction.

Component Separation To address the imbalance in the proposed dataset and other related
datasets, an equal number of segments from each dataset were selected. Following data segmen-
tation, normalization, and filtering, the raw EDA data still contained redundant information. To
enhance the results, additional data processing was necessary. Artifacts in the EDA data, caused
---
by sensor movement on the skin and changes in skin moisture, posed challenges for accurate stress
assessment. Therefore, it was crucial to extract the SCR and SCL components and apply artifact
removal techniques for more accurate analysis. The cvxEDA model [36], which is based on maximum
a posteriori (MAP) estimation, sparsity, and convex optimization, was employed to decompose the
SCR and SCL components, thereby refining the accuracy of stress severity prediction models.
---
Feature Extraction Feature extraction is vital for building feature vectors for training the pro-
posed framework. Since training with all feature vectors in physiological EDA signals is computa-
tionally expensive, we perform data clustering of selected discriminatory features to reduce computa-
tional costs. Additionally, statistical characteristics and SCR attributes from recorded physiological
signals are considered for a detailed analysis of stress severity for early diagnosis [28]. The feature
---
vectors consist of different discriminatory components of the physiological signals, as shown below:
FeatureVector = [meanEDA, minEDA, maxEDA, stdEDA,
meanSCRonsets, meanSCRamp, meanSCRrecovery]
(6)
Here, meanEDA represents the average EDA value, minEDA and maxEDA represent the minimum
and maximum values, respectively, and stdEDA quantifies the variability of EDA values. The dataset
containing all features, without feature extraction, is utilized for training the deep learning mod-
---
els, which are evaluated based on their classification performance against feature vectors obtained
through extraction techniques.
Splitting of Physiological Dataset After preprocessing, the data is partitioned into two segments:
(1) training and (2) testing, based on either collected samples or subjects. During the training phase,
the preprocessed data is converted into feature vectors to train the models. This training phase helps
---
mitigate interference factors or latent variables inherent in individual physiological signals, includ-
ing the relationship between emotional states and EDA data. Consequently, subject-independent
analyses are more advantageous compared to subject-dependent methods. During the testing phase,
the performance of the proposed framework is validated using 5-fold cross-validation. In this cross-
validation approach, the test sample datasets are divided into different folds, with each fold typically
---
consisting of 10% of the subjects and corresponding physiological data designated as the testing set.
In contrast, the remaining subjects are allocated for training.

j are the main components of a feedforward neural network (FNN). We used FNNs to
assess physiological signals obtained from wearable sensors. By sending physiological signal data into

the FNN’s input layer, the network learned to extract stress-related properties. The FNN’s hidden
layers processed the input data, changing it into representations that may be used to forecast stress
levels. Based on the processed input data, the output layer made predictions about the stress severity
level.
Wide and Deep Learning Model The wide and deep learning approach combines a linear model
for feature interactions with a deep neural network to handle complicated patterns. The linear
---
component records specific feature associations, but the deep layers generalize using hierarchical
representations to improve prediction accuracy. The combined output y is y = f(x; θ) + h(x), where
x represents input features, θ represents linear model parameters, f(x; θ) is the broad component,
and h(x) is the deep component. For the broad component, f(x; θ) = Pn
i=1 θixi, where n represents
the number of features. The deep component, h(x), consists of many layers with weights Wi and
---
biases bi, using an activation function σ, generally ReLU. The Wide and Deep Learning Models were
used to assess physiological information captured by wearable sensors. By combining both shallow
and deep data representations, the model efficiently caught both subtle and complicated stress-
related patterns. The wide component identified specific feature correlations in physiological signals,
and the deep component learned hierarchical representations to generalize across stress contexts.

layers make up the foundation of the CNN architecture. The convolutional operation is defined as
follows:
(f ∗g)(t) =
X
a
f(a)g(t −a)
(7)
Here,f represents the input physiological signals acquired from EDA sensors, g denotes the filter
or kernel with dimensions of 3 × 3, and t represents the position within the output feature map.
During the convolutional operation, the filter g is slid over the input image f, centered at different
---
positions. At each position, the filter g interacts with the input data around the location t, computing
the convolution operation to produce a single value in the output feature map. Pooling layers lower
spatial dimensions, whereas fully connected layers classify them. In our stress prediction study, we
used CNNs to examine physiological information acquired from EDA sensors. The customized CNNs
learned the relevant stress-related properties by considering the physiological signal data as a time-
---
series sequence. Convolutional layers discovered temporal patterns in the signals, while pooling layers
reduced noise and extracted essential characteristics. Fully linked layers used the derived information
to forecast stress levels. The above models are trained with a learning rate of 0.001, using the Adam
optimizer, a dropout rate of 0.2, and L2 regularization with a value of 0.001.

using all features, particularly in the UTD, MSD-Nurse, and DriveDB datasets. The FNN model
achieved the highest accuracy on the VerBIO and SWELL datasets, while the CNN model demon-
strated superior accuracy on the WESAD dataset.When focusing on extracted features, the CNN
model outperformed other models in predicting stress severity across the VerBIO, UTD, WESAD,

Evaluation of the Effect of Multimodal Fusion
We further refined our classification model by integrating multiple signal types obtained from a
wrist-worn wearable device, aiming to explore the potential impact of different physiological signals
---
on stress severity prediction. Our focus encompassed ECG, PPG, and EDA, given their availability in
wearable devices. ECG captures the timing and diverse electrical signals associated with heartbeats,
while PPG utilizes non-invasive technology to measure changes in blood volume within living tissue.
Both heartbeats and vasoconstriction, which respond to stimulation, can influence ECG and PPG
signals. Consequently, the amalgamation of ECG and PPG data holds promise for yielding valuable
---
insights into effective stress severity prediction.

Multimodal signals are fused at three levels: sensor-level fusion merges raw data from multiple
sensors, feature-level fusion integrates extracted features, and decision-level fusion combines outputs
for final inference. In this study, signals from three different sensors were concatenated to create
a new feature vector for classification. Features derived from ECG and PPG data were utilized,
---
with principal component analysis (PCA) applied to ECG data to extract significant elements from
heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) time series. Additionally, PPG features such as
maximum HR after stimulus onset (PPG-Rate-Max), minimum HR after stimulus onset (PPG-Rate-
Min), mean HR after stimulus onset (PPG-Rate-Mean), and standard deviation of heart rate after
stimulus onset (PPG-Rate-SD) were incorporated. We examined the Verbio and WESAD datasets,
---
which contain EDA, ECG, and PPG signals, for multimodal stress severity prediction. Tables-5
and Table-6 display the detection accuracy based on various modalities and different combinations
among them.

Conclusion and Future Directions
In this work, we proposed a multimodal framework using three deep learning techniques to evaluate
performance based on six publicly available EDA datasets for stress classification. The proposed
framework and different classifiers were trained on both extracted and all features, including ex-
---
tracted EDA features, separately. Additionally, multimodal fusion was conducted on three datasets,
VerBIO and WESAD, utilizing combinations of EDA, ECG, and PPG signals.
Overall, our proposed framework demonstrated strong performance across all features. The Wide and
Deep model yielded the highest accuracy in the UTD, MSD-Nurse, and DriveDB datasets, achieving
accuracies of 93.3%, 75.6%, and 65.1%, respectively. The FNN model achieved the highest accuracy
---
in the VerBIO and SWELL datasets, with accuracies of 76.9% and 81.7%, respectively. The CNN
model performed well on the WESAD dataset, achieving an accuracy of 90.2%. When focusing on ex-
tracted features, our CNN framework excelled in four datasets, achieving high accuracies in VerBIO,
UTD, WESAD, and MSD-Nurse, with accuracies of 96.2%, 98.1%, 97.3%, and 89.4%, respectively.
The FNN model demonstrated the highest accuracy for the SWELL and DriveDB datasets, with
---
accuracies of 92.3% and 88.7%, respectively, in stress severity prediction. These findings underscore
the effectiveness of our multimodal framework and highlight the importance of feature selection and
fusion techniques in stress severity prediction using wearable sensor data.
In future endeavors, we plan to extend our multimodal framework to enable early detection of stress
across diverse datasets encompassing signals, speech, and facial images. Our efforts will concentrate
---
on aggregating extensive datasets to facilitate cross-validation of experimental outcomes across var-
ious benchmark settings. By leveraging multimodal deep learning techniques, we aim to achieve
early diagnosis and precise prediction of stress in both patients and general populations, thereby
advancing the field of stress management and healthcare.
