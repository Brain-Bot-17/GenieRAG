Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur
• Semi-Annotation Tool Design: Developed a semi-annotation tool to streamline agricultural image annotation with bounding
boxes, significantly improving efficiency and reducing manual annotation workload.
• Leaf Tip Detection Enhancement: Enhanced leaf tip detection for plant phenotyping analysis using YOLO and Faster R-CNN,
increasing accuracy and aiding in better crop monitoring and health assessment.
PROJECTS
• GenieRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation System
FAISS, Facebook OPT-350M, Sentence Transformers, FastAPI
Designed and implemented a RAG system leveraging FAISS and Facebook OPT-350M for extracting and processing text from
PDFs to generate precise responses. Integrated Sentence Transformers for generating embeddings and built a FastAPI
framework for serving the model efficiently with optimized query performance. Enhanced retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
embedding models and improving indexing techniques for faster and more reliable text-based predictions.
• MindReader: Emotion Detection Using Deep Learning Models
CNN-GRU, CNN-LSTM, Sentence-BERT, Streamlit
Engineered CNN-GRU and CNN-LSTM architectures for emotion classification tasks, leveraging Sentence-BERT embeddings
for semantic feature extraction. Developed a Streamlit app for real-time emotion detection and comprehensive model
evaluation, improving user experience, engagement, and interactive visualization capabilities. Implemented extensive
performance tuning techniques, including hyperparameter optimization and dropout layers, to boost classification accuracy
and model robustness.
• Cricket Batsman Performance Analysis System
MongoDB, CatBoost, AWS EC2, Vercel
Scraped Cricbuzz data and stored it in MongoDB; used CatBoost to predict player performance with high accuracy and
reliability. Deployed the backend on AWS EC2 and the frontend on Vercel, providing a full-stack, scalable solution for cricket
analytics with real-time data insights. Incorporated advanced feature engineering techniques to improve predictive
performance, enabling more precise player performance trends and match outcome forecasting.
